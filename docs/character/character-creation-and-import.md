# Character Creation and Import

## Creating a Character

To create a unique character for chatting and role-playing, click “Create Character” on the main page or in the catalog.

### Character Avatar

The avatar shows what your character looks like and makes interactions more lively. You can:

- Upload an image from your device by clicking “Choose Image”.
- Generate one using AI by clicking “Generate New Avatar”.

!!! info

	The first message is a greeting that sets the tone for the dialogue and influences the model’s behavior. It is recommended to create at least one greeting in English.

	Use `*asterisks*` to highlight actions and `"quotes"` for speech.

	Use the variables `{{user}}` to address the player and `{{char}}` to address the character.

### Backgrounds

For each greeting, you can set a background. Upload an image (“Choose file”) or generate one (“Generate New Backgrounds”). You can use up to 6 images. To assign a background to a greeting, open the “Assign to greeting” menu on the desired image and select the message.
